# Problem 2: Inverse vs. Forward Problems (6 points)
**Provide three examples of inverse and forward problems, and discuss their relative computational difficulty.**

1. **Example 1: Physics**
   - **Forward Problem:** Predicting the motion of a projectile given initial velocity and angle.  
   - **Inverse Problem:** Determining the initial velocity and angle from observed projectile motion.  
   - **Difficulty:** Inverse problems are generally harder due to noise and potential non-uniqueness in the data.

2. **Example 2: Imaging**
   - **Forward Problem:** Generating a 2D image projection from a 3D object model.  
   - **Inverse Problem:** Reconstructing a 3D object model from 2D image projections.  
   - **Difficulty:** Inverse problems are computationally more intensive due to the need for solving complex equations and dealing with incomplete data.

3. **Example 3: Machine Learning**
   - **Forward Problem:** Predicting output labels from input features using a trained model.  
   - **Inverse Problem:** Inferring the input features that might produce a specific output.  
   - **Difficulty:** Inverse problems often involve solving optimization tasks that are non-linear or ill-posed, making them significantly more challenging.
