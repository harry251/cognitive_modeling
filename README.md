Cognitive modeling is important for psychology and cognitive science because it helps researchers simulate and analyze how the mind processes information, such as perception, memory, problem-solving, and decision-making. This provides insight into the mechanisms underlying human thought.
By creating computational or mathematical representations of cognitive processes, researchers can test and refine theoretical frameworks in a controlled and systematic way.
