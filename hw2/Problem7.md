The output indicates that the custom function produced density values that are nearly identical to those from SciPyâ€™s implementation across all three cases:

Accuracy:
For each test case (Spherical, Diagonal, and Full-Covariance), the densities computed by both methods agree to many decimal places. This confirms that the mathematical implementation of the multivariate normal density in the custom function is correct.

Performance:
The timing results show that the custom function is consistently faster than the SciPy implementation:

Spherical case: Custom function ~0.218 seconds vs. SciPy ~0.651 seconds for 10,000 runs.
Diagonal case: Custom function ~0.122 seconds vs. SciPy ~0.618 seconds.
Full-Covariance case: Custom function ~0.120 seconds vs. SciPy ~0.604 seconds.
This suggests that the custom function is computationally more efficient in these tests. 

Overall Evaluation:
The GPT-generated function performed very well. It accurately computes the density and, in these timing tests, it runs faster than the SciPy counterpart while maintaining numerical correctness across different parameterizations.
