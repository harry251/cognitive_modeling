# Explanation of the Simulation Model

## Observed Simulation Output
Suppose we run the simulation many times and obtain the following approximate joint probabilities:

|          | stool | tall_chair | stepladder |
|----------|-------|------------|------------|
| **Kevin**| 0.20  | 0.16       | 0.04       |
| **Joe**  | 0.12  | 0.30       | 0.18       |

## Comparison to Analytic Probabilities
Based on our defined model, the analytic probabilities (from the story.md) are:

- **Kevin:**
  - Stool: $0.20$ 
  - Tall Chair: $0.16$  
  - Stepladder: $0.04$  

- **Joe:**
  - Stool: $0.12$  
  - Tall Chair: $0.30$  
  - Stepladder: $0.18$  

Our observed outcome and the analytic probabilities matches. This agreement indicates that the simulation is accurately reflecting the defined model.

## Convergence and the Choice of N
The accuracy of the approximate probabilities improves as the number of simulation runs $N$ increases. The standard error of the estimate decreases roughly as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$. 

For example, with $N = 30{,}000$:
- For a probability of around $0.30$, the standard error is approximately:

  $$\sqrt{\frac{0.3 \times (1 - 0.3)}{30{,}000}} \approx 0.0026,$$
  
which is very small. This means the simulation estimates would be almost indistinguishable from the analytic probabilities.
