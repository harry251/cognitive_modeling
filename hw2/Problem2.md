## Problem 2:

$$ E[X] = (0.8 \times 0.01) + (0.2 \times -0.1) $$  
$$ = 0.008 - 0.02 $$  
$$ = -0.012 $$  
$$ = -1.2\% $$  

**Decision:** No invest  

If fixed, assume $p$ is the probability of the market going up:

$$ (p \times 0.01) + (1 - p) \times (-0.1) \geq 0 $$  
$$ 0.01p - 0.1 + 0.1p \geq 0 $$  
$$ 0.11p \geq 0.1 $$  
$$ p \geq 0.909 $$  
$$ p \geq 90.9\% $$  

The minimal probability of prices going up in order for you to invest rationally is **90.9%**.

### Real-life situation:
The model doesnâ€™t take risk and variance into consideration. In real life, investors might have ways to avoid or control the risk, making it still investment-worthy even if the expected return is negative.
