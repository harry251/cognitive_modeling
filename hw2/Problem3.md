## Problem 3:

### 1. Show the following identity for the variance of a random variable $X$: 

$$
Var[X] = E\left[ (X - E[X])^2 \right]
$$

$$
= E\left( X^2 - 2X E[X] + (E[X])^2 \right)
$$

$$
= E[X^2] - 2E[X]E[X] + (E[X])^2
$$

$$
= E[X^2] - E[X]^2
$$

Hence, we have shown that $Var[X] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2$.


### 2. Show the following property for the variance of a random variable $X$ and a scalar $\alpha$: 

$$
Var[\alpha X + \beta] = 
$$

Hence, we have shown that $Var[\alpha X + \beta] = \alpha^2 Var[X]$
