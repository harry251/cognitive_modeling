    "Shichao: One key takeaway for me is how central probabilistic thinking is to understanding human cognition. Before this course, I thought of cognition mostly in terms of deterministic processesâ€”stimulus in, response out. But through topics like Bayesian regression, predictive distributions, and model comparison, I came to appreciate how much more realistic and flexible probabilistic models are for capturing uncertainty, noise, and variability in behavior.\n",
    "For example, when modeling perception or decision-making, deterministic predictions fail to explain trial-by-trial fluctuations or confidence judgments. However, Bayesian models naturally account for this uncertainty and allow for probabilistic inference, which aligns more closely with how real minds operate in uncertain environments. I now see probabilistic modeling not just as a tool for statistics, but as a core framework for theorizing about how the mind represents and processes information under uncertainty."
