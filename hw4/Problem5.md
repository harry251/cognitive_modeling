## Problem 5: Reflection

**Harry**: Initially registering for the course and even when mentioned in class, I never imagined or didn't understand how learning about Bayesian modeling leads to deep learning. I didn't expect the journey to come full circle, starting from simple statistics and decision-making and ending with simulation-based inference and neural networks. I loved the hands-on interactions with notebooks, converting theoretical concepts into actual code. Most classes I have taken focus on only one aspect. Also, looking back, I wish I had taken this course before my undergraduate research with Professor Benjamin Weissman where I attempted to use Bayesian modeling. At the time, modeling felt abstract and out of reach. Maybe I can revisit the work with new tools. Through this course, I gained a deeper understanding of cognitive modeling and skills I'll continue to build on, especially as I pursue a Master's research in AI. 

**Shichao**: One key takeaway for me is how central probabilistic thinking is to understanding human cognition. Before this course, I thought of cognition mostly in terms of deterministic processesâ€”stimulus in, response out. But through topics like Bayesian regression, predictive distributions, and model comparison, I came to appreciate how much more realistic and flexible probabilistic models are for capturing uncertainty, noise, and variability in behavior.
For example, when modeling perception or decision-making, deterministic predictions fail to explain trial-by-trial fluctuations or confidence judgments. However, Bayesian models naturally account for this uncertainty and allow for probabilistic inference, which aligns more closely with how real minds operate in uncertain environments. I now see probabilistic modeling not just as a tool for statistics, but as a core framework for theorizing about how the mind represents and processes information under uncertainty.
