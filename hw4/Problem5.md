## Problem 5: Reflection

Harry: Initially registering for the course and even when mentioned in class, I never imagined or didn't understand how learning about Bayesian modeling leads to deep learning. I didn't expect the journey to come full circle, starting from simple statistics and decision-making and ending with simulation-based inference and neural networks. I loved the hands-on interactions with notebooks, converting theoretical concepts into actual code. Most classes I have taken focus on only one aspect. Also, looking back, I wish I had taken this course before my undergraduate research with Professor Benjamin Weissman where I attempted to use Bayesian modeling. At the time, modeling felt abstract and out of reach. Maybe I can revisit the work with new tools. Through this course, I gained a deeper understanding of cognitive modeling and skills I'll continue to build on, especially as I pursue a Master's research in AI.
